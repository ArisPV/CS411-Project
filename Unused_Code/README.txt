This file contains unused code that works, however it is incompatible with the implementation of our app currently. 
If we want to be more ambitious in the future, we can use this code as it provides much more data than the other one, and we can use it
to analyze the images further than we have with the current implementation. I am leaving it all here so that it is not lost (Although
GitHub should simply record all of the changes that happened anyways.)
