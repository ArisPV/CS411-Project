Object analysis story

As a logged-in user, I want to navigate to a "Image-object analysis" page that displays graphically how successful my posts are based off of trends of what objects the image contains, so that I can learn what content interests my followers the most.

User must be logged in (See log in story)
The user clicks a button or meny item to navigate to the object analysis page.
The page displays a graph that shows what objects in the images are prevalent, based off of their posting data.
On the x axis, the objects in the images are shown; on the y axis, the # of interactions (likes+comments). 
Each of the objects that are noted in the pictures will be indicated in the graph by a bar stretching from the bottom up, indicating popularity based off of the interactions.
If the user has not made any posts, a message appears instead.
The message indicates to the user that they need to have already made posts to use this feature.
