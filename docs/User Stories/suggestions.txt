Suggestions story

As a logged-in user, I want to navigate to a "Suggestions" page that suggests what type of content I should be posting to my Instagram account and what time I should be posting based off of the data it collects.

User must be logged in (See log in story)
The data used will be displayed on other pages (See object analysis and time analysis stories)
The page will display suggestions of what objects your images should contain based off of their posting data.
The page will display suggestions of what time they should post these images, based off of their posting data.
The page will combine both time and object to show the user what would be the optimal post that they could do in order to have it recieved the best.
If the user has not made any posts, a message appears instead.
The message indicates to the user that they need to have already made posts to use this feature.
