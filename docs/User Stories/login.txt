Log-in story 

As a first-time user, I want to be prompted to log-in via Instagram so that I can begin using the app.

As the first-time user opens the site, a message appears in the middle of the screen that prompts the user to log-in.
When the user clicks the log-in button, a window appears that contains username and password fields for their instagram account.
If the user enters a valid username and the correct password, the "log-in" message disappears, revealing the rest of the application.
If the username/password does not match, the user will be prompted to try again.
Until the user has successfully logged in, the rest of the site's features will not be accessible.
